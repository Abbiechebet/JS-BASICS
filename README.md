• Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
  Statically typed programming languages
  a. perform type checking at compile time.
  If a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
  b.  require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them.
         Examples: C#, C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

  
  Dynamically typed programming languages 
  a. perform type checking at runtime
  This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly.
  b. do not require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them. 
          Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang

• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;
null is used explicitly to purposefully indicate lack of a value, whereas

 undefined can be returned implicitly by JavaScript to denote an unexpected error-like absence of value, declared but uninitialized variable, declared variable without any value initialized to them  (not even null), non-existent property of an object.
